# elasticsearch设置高亮Highlighting

[链接](https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/search_dsl.html#highlighting)
To set common attributes for highlighting use the highlight_options method:
```
s = s.highlight_options(order='score')
```
Enabling highlighting for individual fields is done using the highlight method:
```

s = s.highlight('title')
```
# or, including parameters:
```
s = s.highlight('title', fragment_size=50)
```
The fragments in the response will then be available on each Result object as .meta.highlight.FIELD which will contain the list of fragments:
```
response = s.execute()
for hit in response:
    for fragment in hit.meta.highlight.title:
        print(fragment)
```
